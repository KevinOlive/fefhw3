  <h1>Danish Puff</h1>
  <p>A custardy cloud resting on top of a buttery, flaky crust, topped with a sweet glaze and sprinkled with nuts. It has been a favorite for years and I was surprised twice: someone from the Great British Bakeoff was going to make it and Mary Berry had never heard of it.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crust</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Â½ cup butter, softened</li>

      <li>1 cup water</li>

    <ol>
      <li>Cut butter into flour until particles are the size of small peas.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with water; mix with fork. Gather pastry into a ball; Refrigerate for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Divide into halves; patting each half into a rectangle, 12x3" (3" apart), on ungreased cookie sheet. Use a pastry scraper to square up.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Choux<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pix.iemoji.com/images/emoji/apple/ios-12/256/high-heeled-shoe.png" width="35"></li>

    </ol>
    <li>Glaze<img src="https://banner2.kisspng.com/20180502/hbw/kisspng-frosting-icing-donuts-pastry-bag-bakery-birthday-vector-money-bag-5ae97c804b4bd1.0884251115252512003084.jpg" width="35"></li>
    <ol>
<li>Mix powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla. <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/160/emojipedia/181/butter_1f9c8.png" width="35"></li><li>Stir in water until smooth and of desired consistency.</li><li>Spread on top; sprinkle with nuts.</li>
    </ol>

<p>The topping will puff while baking and barely expand over the edge of the crust. The glaze will appear to slightly weigh down the puff but it collapses when it cools to form the custardy center.
  Like many pastries, it is a sweet, and messy, confection with a flaky bottom crust while the choux, although crisp on the outside, has a custardy center. Because flour, butter and eggs doesn't make a strong flavor, the almond extract adds to the bulk of it.</p>

<h3>Other Versions</h3>
<p>I was surprised to read some of the descriptions for the Danish Puff. Many people recount stories of how the recipe was handed down over generations. I got mine from a "Gold Medal Flour" anniversary cookbook.</p>
<p>King Arthur Flour has a very similar <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/almond-puff-loaf-recipe" target=blank>recipe</a> that adds jam to the top before glazing. I made some and it was even better.</p>
<p>Dirty Laundry Kitchen has what appears to be the same <a href="http://www.dirtylaundrykitchen.com/danish-puffs/" target=blank>recipe</a>
