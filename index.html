  <h1>Danish Puff</h1>
  <p>A custardy cloud resting on top of a buttery, flaky crust, topped with a sweet glaze and sprinkled with nuts. It has been a favorite for years and I was surprised twice: someone from the Great British Bakeoff was going to make it and Mary Berry had never heard of it.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crust</li>

      <li>Â½ cup butter, softened</li>

<p>The topping will puff while baking and barely expand over the edge of the crust. The glaze will appear to slightly weigh down the puff but it collapses when it cools to form the custardy center.
  Like many pastries, it is a sweet, and messy, confection with a flaky bottom crust while the choux, although crisp on the outside, has a custardy center. Because flour, butter and eggs doesn't make a strong flavor, the almond extract adds to the bulk of it.</p>

<h3>Other Versions</h3>
<p>I was surprised to read some of the descriptions for the Danish Puff. Several people recounted stories of how the recipe was handed down over generations or how it was made for special occassions. I got mine from a "Gold Medal Flour" anniversary cookbook.</p>
<p><i>From a test kitchen</i>, makes the <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/danish-puff/" target="_blank">recipe</a> seem slightly more authentic, I guess.
<p>King Arthur Flour has a very similar <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/almond-puff-loaf-recipe" target="_blank">recipe</a> that adds jam to the top before glazing. I made some and it was better than normal.</p>
<p>Dirty Laundry Kitchen has what appears to be the same <a href="http://www.dirtylaundrykitchen.com/danish-puffs/" target="_blank">recipe</a>
<p>Another family memory <a href="https://www.beyerbeware.net/2018/04/almond-danish-puff-pastry.html" target="_blank">recipe</a> description</p>
<p>Relating stories to recipes is quite natural as a food's flavor and aroma are good for jogging old memories. My sister and I would make these for no reason at all other than to indulge.</p>
